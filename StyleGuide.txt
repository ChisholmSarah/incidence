Object names:
	function names are lower case
	variable names upper case, with each word starting with an upper case e.g. MyVariable

Spacing:
	Spaces around all infix operators (=, +, -, <-, etc)
	Space after comma
	Space before left parentheses, except in a function call
	Extra spacing (i.e. more than one space in a row) is ok if it improves alignment or equal signe or assignments (<-)
	Do noy place spaces around code in parentheses or square brackets (unless there's a comma)

Curly braces
	An opening curly brace should never go on its own line and should always be followed by a new line
	A closing curly brace should always go on its own line, unless it is followed by else
	Always indent the code inside curly braces

Indentation
	When indenting code, use two space
	The only exception is if a function definition runs over multiple lines
	In that case, indent the second line to where the definition starts

Assignment
	Use <-, not =, for assignment

Commenting guidlines
	Each line of a comment should begin with the comment sumbol and a single space
	Comments should explain the why, not the what
	Use commented lines of - and == to break up your file into easily readable chunks
